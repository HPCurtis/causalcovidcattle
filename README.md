The following work is highly inspired by the work of [Rami Kasparin](https://ramikrispin.github.io/2021/01/covid19-effect/), [Matheus Facure](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html) and the work of [CausalPy and all its developers](https://causalpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#interrupted-time-series) and generally [Hyndman & Athanasopoulos](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) incredible book and associated timeseries analysis packages that they developed thsat are simple brilliant.
