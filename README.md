# Causal impact of Covid on Australian Cattle livestock slaughter numbers
 
The following analysis is investigation into whether Covid had any potential causal impact on the Australian cattle market in the form of the number of cattle that were slaughtered. Specifically, the analysis here uses an interupted time-series quasi-experimental methodology to analyse whether the number of cattle slaughtered was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The following work is highly inspired by the work of [Rami Kasparin](https://ramikrispin.github.io/2021/01/covid19-effect/), [Matheus Facure](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html) and the work of [CausalPy and all its developers](https://causalpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#interrupted-time-series) and generally [Hyndman & Athanasopoulos](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) incredible book and their associated timeseries analysis packages that are simple brilliant.
